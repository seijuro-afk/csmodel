## About This Project

This project dives deep into the Philippine Labor Force Survey (LFS) April 2016 microdata, unraveling trends in employment, unemployment, and underemployment across regions. 
By leveraging Python’s powerful data analysis libraries, we clean, explore, and visualize a dataset covering over 180,000 survey responses from across the nation. 
From demographic distributions to employment patterns, our analysis provides insights that policymakers, researchers, and educators can use to better understand the country’s workforce landscape.
